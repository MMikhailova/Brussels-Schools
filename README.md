# Brussels Schools Website
 A website displaying all schools in Brussels with a goal to help parents find the best school for their child.
 
# Introduction

As a parent, I have struggled a lot to find a school for my kid in Brussels.
Although there are many schools here some of them don't have a website or even a marker on the Google maps.
Therefore, on this website, my goal was to give parents an overview of the schools in Brussels so that they can choose the closest/best one.
I found an open source data list of schools on [www.odwb.be](https://www.odwb.be/pages/home/) and consumed its API.


The project is developed by [MMikhailova](https://github.com/MMikhailova)

The main features of the Website are:

- [x] Map with schools marked on it
- [x] Filters with criteria for choosing a school
- [x] List of schools based on chosen filters
